NLTK Tools
==========

A collection of tools that I'm building to help me with a little NLP project
using Python's (NLTK)[http://nltk.org/] package. 

Currently, this repo allows you to build your own corpus in the format that
is compatible with the rest of the NLTK's corpora

Structure here will quite likely change as I add more tools.
